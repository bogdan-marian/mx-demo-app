# question 1
I'm trying to recreate the simple nextj app 
I'm referring to this tempalte: https://github.com/multiversx/mx-template-dapp-nextjs
But the way that app is wired is way to complicated. Can we start from zero? and have also simple set of instructions on how to recreate a working demo where you can run the app after each step and see it working with the new bits wired correctly?

This is my repo: https://github.com/bogdan-marian/mx-demo-app
This is what I did so fare. 
- npx create-next-app@latest
- npm install @multiversx/sdk-core
- npm install @multiversx/sdk-dapp
- npm install @multiversx/sdk-network-providers

Also if possible can we simplify how the app is wired?
What syould be my next step?
